# Stress-PostPredator
**Title**: Stress-Related Sex Differences in Defensive and Exploratory Behaviors in the Presence of a Predatory Stimulus

Our study employed an ethologically relevant fear stimulus to simulate a predator attack on both male and female Long Evan rats over several trials to assess fear-based behavior.

**Hypothesis**: Examination of sex differences in contextual fear learning in response to a visual predator stimulus. Female rats are expected to have higher stress-reactive, defensive behaviors, and reduced exploratory behaviors in comparison to male rats after exposure to a predatory stimulus.
